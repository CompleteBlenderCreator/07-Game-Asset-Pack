*Below is a rough projection of the topics in this section and is a copy from previous Gothic Church Section*
*This will change as this section is fleshed out*

## Section Introduction

* You are going to make several models. 
* We’ll be making both high poly and low poly versions of out assets.
* We will emphasise how critical naming is when working with a larger project like this.
* You will be able to create your own mapping, with these we can make the illusion of detail.
* We’ll be constantly checking our model externally
* This will be focused mainly on an interior environment.

## Section Specification

* Create assets to be exported straight into an external program, like a game engine.
* Creating our own textures, and other maps from high detail models and apply them to a low poly version.
* Only modelling the interior of the Gothic Church.

* You can use this technique within Blender itself too for optimisation. 
* I am going to be testing my model externally as I go. I will use Unity to do this.

* I will be keeping my scene simple, primarily for teaching purposes! 
* I encourage you to add more detail, experiment and have fun. Wouldn’t the scene look much more interesting with a chess set in it.

## Planning Your Project
* Plan your project, define it’s scope and your goals- important to prevent scope slip!
* Gather your reference material, if possible explore real world locations to get a feeling. Scour the web for images for you references too.

### Building Blocks & Modular Thinking
* Think about ways of building that make parts reusable and modular… Think Lego.
* Realise this gives you quick iterations, and great prototyping potential from a few parts.
* If you are supplier of assets your level maker is going to love that they can redesign with your assets!

## An Overview of Source Control
* The what and why of Version Control Systems
* Choosing your Version Control System (VCS)
* What files to include / exclude
* Commit = save a local snapshot
* Reset = roll-back to a previous state
* Branch, Push and Large File Support later.

### Popular Version Control Systems
* Git
* Mercurial
* Perforce
* Subversion / TortoiseSVN
* Alienbrain (for art but of order $10,000)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software

### About SourceTree
* Free software by Atlassian
* Visual front-end for Git or Mercurial
* Mac and PC but Mac version is a little ahead
* Good when learning as easy to visualise.

## File Structure & Naming
* Understand that there is NO one way of setting up your filing system. 
* Have a personal style of filing, if you don’t like mine, use yours.
* Talk with your ‘team’ you will form guidelines from your own needs.

### Some Rigidty
*In a Team environment you will have guidelines or discuss with colleagues.
* Some other software might expect certain things to be stored and named in a certain way.

### Naming
* In a Team / larger project it is critical that you can find assets, materials, textures.
* Naming files well will help you and others.
* There are some naming conventions that we will use in this section.

### In Blender Organisation
* We are going to be making a much more complex scene than any previously made.
* Organise it as you go, not afterwards!
* Use description names, cube, cube.001 etc is not helpful to anyone!

## Level Of Detail (LOD)
* Focus on representations of the right size and shape, but JUST Block work models.
* This allows quick iteration of your models.
* Remember higher detail ofter requires more processing time too!

### LOD Numbers and Letters
* LOD 0 often refers to the highest detail model sometimes called the base model.
* To avoid confusion, we are going to use Letters!
* A represents the lowest polygon model, with B,C,D etc increasing in detail.

### Watch Your Time / LOD
* LOD and time taken at usually directly proportional to one another.
* When fleshing out a scene and prototyping you probably want quiet a few assets. 
* You can test models and your scene quickly.

### LOD vs. Time Taken Example
#### “LOD”
* A - B - C - D
#### Polygons*
* 200 - 2,000 - 20,000 - 200,000
#### Time Taken**
*30mins - 2 hours - 1 day - 1 Week+

*Every polygon counts!*

*Time includes other artwork too*
